# Executive Summary

Vitor Rodrigues is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 4+ years of experience building fraud prevention systems and GenAI solutions at Mercado Livre (Latin America's largest e-commerce platform), ClearSale, and Cappta (Stone Co.). His work sits at the intersection of applied machine learning and production software engineering — designing models that prevent financial loss and deploying them into real-time decision systems that process hundreds of millions of transactions per month.

At Mercado Livre, Vitor owns the full ML lifecycle for Account Takeover (ATO) and chargeback fraud detection. He designed and deployed a GenAI agent framework that automated manual ATO report review, reducing operational workload by 70% and freeing 15–20 analysts from repetitive triage. His fraud prevention models generate $30k–$50k USD in monthly savings by intercepting fraudulent transfers and chargebacks before they reach completion. He engineers the feature pipelines (200M+ rows/month), manages model experiments in MLflow, deploys containerised models to GCP Vertex AI with canary rollout, and monitors production performance via Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.

## Impact Highlights

- **Operational efficiency**: Automated ATO report review via GenAI agents → 70% workload reduction, 15–20 analysts freed
- **Financial impact**: Fraud prevention models (chargeback + ATO) → $30k–$50k USD/month in savings
- **Scale**: Feature engineering pipelines processing 200M+ rows/month with parallelised execution
- **Response time**: Reduced KPI fluctuation response time by 40% through automated monitoring dashboards (ClearSale)
- **Data visibility**: Improved risk department data visibility by 50% via SQL-based reporting architecture (Cappta)
- **Technical depth**: PyTorch deep learning (custom training loops, DDP multi-GPU, AMP), model export (TorchScript/ONNX), full MLOps stack
- **Cross-border**: Daily collaboration in Spanish across LATAM teams; technical alignment and mentoring in Spanish
